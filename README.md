# dodgeball

Simple browsergame created using html and javascript.

Controls: WASD/Arrow keys, spacebar

Objective: Survive as long as possible

Most progress was done in 2020 but there were several bugs and technical issues, I recently decided to finish the project. 
This game has been a learning experience, as I have never made anything like this before. I refrained from usinf any fancy tools or frameworks.
The long pause in development means that there can be some inconsistencies in the code (I hope that the newer code is better than the lines I wrote in 2020..)

Everything created by me, except for sound effects (slowmo, whistle, dodgeball hit sound, oof!)

The game is very unfair and highly luck-based, but I think it suits the subject :)
